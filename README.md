   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db mysql -u root -p
   ```

### Testing Stripe Integration

1. Use Stripe test mode and test cards:
   - Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002

2. Test webhooks using Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8080/api/webhooks/stripe.php
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify database credentials in `src/config/database.php`
   - Ensure MySQL service is running

2. **Stripe Integration Issues**
   - Confirm API keys are correct
   - Check webhook endpoint configuration
   - Verify SSL is properly configured for production

3. **Docker Issues**
   - Run `docker-compose down -v` and then `docker-compose up -d` to rebuild containers
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Security Considerations

- All admin pages require authentication and proper role authorization
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- Stripe webhooks are verified using the webhook secret
- Input validation is implemented throughout the application
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
